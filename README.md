# MovieLens100k Recommendation Study

##  Project Objective

The aim of this project is to build a foundational understanding of recommendation algorithms using the MovieLens 100k dataset.  
The goal is to apply these insights to practical tasks, such as the H&M personalized fashion recommendation challenge on Kaggle.

##  Analysis Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Clustering** on both items and users 
2. **Matrix Factorization** techniques including SVD, NMF, and MF 
3. **Benchmarking with RecBole**: Reproducing various recommendation models from the RecBole framework
4. **Visualizing Algorithm Similarity**: Mapping relationships among models as a network graph 

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: All experiments and daily logs (EDA, modeling, evaluation)
- `experiments/`: Hyperparameter configs, results summary, and comparison reports
- `models/`: Saved trained models
- `data/`: MovieLens100k dataset (excluded from Git via `.gitignore`)

##  Notes

- This repository is intended for learning and personal research.
- Code and models are being incrementally added as the project progresses.
